⚡ Mizy Infinity Network (MIN)

Dual-Utility Blockchain Infrastructure Protocol
BNB Smart Builders Challenge Submission
BNB Smart Chain Compatible

🌍 Overview

Mizy Infinity Network (MIN) is a dual-utility blockchain protocol designed to enable transparent, on-chain accounting for electricity and water usage in emerging markets.
The system introduces a Sovereign Node model, where each household is registered on-chain and utility consumption is immutably recorded.
Initial pilot focus: Soweto, South Africa.

🚨 The Problem
Emerging markets face critical infrastructure challenges:
600+ million Africans lack reliable electricity
Utility billing systems are opaque and inefficient
Paper-based or fragmented tracking creates revenue leakage
No unified dual-utility blockchain infrastructure exists

💡 The Solution
MizyNexus Smart Contract enables:
⚡ Energy tracking in kilowatt-hours (kWh)
💧 Water tracking in liters
Unique household registration via Sovereign Node ID
Immutable on-chain utility accounting
Transparent payment-linked updates

⛓ Smart Contract Details
Contract Name: MizyNexus.sol
Language: Solidity 0.8.20
Test Environment: Remix VM
Target Network: BNB Smart Chain Compatible


Core Functions

Solidity
registerNode(string _nodeId)
payUtility(string _nodeId, uint256 _amount, bool _isWater)

Each registered node maintains:
nodeId
energyKwh
waterLiters
isActive status
