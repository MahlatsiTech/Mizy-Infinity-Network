 Mizy Infinity Network (MIN)

Sovereign Energy. Intelligent Wealth. Built on BNB Chain.

🌍 Vision

Mizy Infinity is a decentralized Energy-Fi protocol designed to bridge the gap between high-level AI automation and physical electrical infrastructure in emerging markets. Our mission is to move 1.2 billion people from energy poverty to energy sovereignty.

👷 Founder: The Engineering Edge

Unlike standard Web3 projects, MIN is founded by Nthabiseng Mahlatsi, a Red Seal Certified Electrical Engineer based in South Africa. This ensures that every Real-World Asset (RWA) integrated into the network meets the highest professional safety and efficiency standards.

🤖 The Technology: "Dual-Arbitrage"

The heart of the network is the Mizy Guardian AI, a Python-based autonomous agent that manages a dual-yield strategy:

DeFi Arbitrage: Utilizing BNB Chain's low-latency environment to generate seed capital through market volatility.

RWA Arbitrage: Managing physical battery storage to sell power back to local grids during peak demand (Load Shedding mitigation).

⛓️ Why BNB Chain?

We utilize the BNB Smart Chain for its:

Low Gas Fees: Essential for micro-energy payments.

High Speed: Necessary for real-time grid response.

RWA Ecosystem: Providing a robust framework for tokenized physical assets.

🚀 Roadmap

Phase 1: AI Core Prototype (Python Engine) - [CURRENT]

Phase 2: Hardware API Integration (Solar Inverter Connectivity)

Phase 3: Pilot Deployment (10 Household Nodes in Soweto)

Phase 4: Pan-African Scaling via BNB Chain Payments
